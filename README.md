# godot_zelda_room_cam
Simple Zelda-styled room cam created in godot. Not intended for actual use, rather for showing the logic behind this particular method.

Hello,

in this little demo project I made a Zelda - style room camera, which moves betwwen rooms whenever the player enters the next one.
This might not be the best approach, but is fairly simple, thus easy to understand and implement it in an actual game.

Best regards
